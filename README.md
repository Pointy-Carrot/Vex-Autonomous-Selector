2. Run this command from terminal: `prosv5 c fetch autoSelect@1.0.0.zip`
3. Then `cd` into your pros project directory in your terminal.
4. And Run this command from terminal: `prosv5 c apply autoSelect@1.0.0`
4. Put this: `#include "selection.h"` at the top of your main.cpp file in your PROS Project.
5. Place `selectorInit();` in `void initazlize(){}` in your main.cpp file.
6. Make if statements in your void `void autonomous() {}` like so:

  `if(autonSelection == 1){ //run auton for Front Blue }`

7. Create multiple if statements for all possible numbers of autonSelection.
8. All possible cases are listed below:
